general notes
---------------
The first design principle of this library is to minimize the time needed
to go from a control algorithm on paper to the same control algorithm 
running on the real robot. The second design principle is to have
the code as simple as possible. In particular, this pertains to avoiding
overly complex abstractions and having the code as concise as possible.
The user is expected to read and understand the entire codebase because
changes will have to accomodate it to their specific project.
Target users are control engineers.
The final design choices are made to accommodate these sometimes opposing goals
to the best of the author's ability.

This file contains a robot manager and a control loop manager.
The point of these managers is to handle:
    - boiler plate code around the control loop which is always the same
    - have all the various parameters neatly organized and in one central location
    - hide the annoying if-elses of different APIs required 
      for the real robot and various simulations with single commands
      that just do exactly what you want them to do


current state
-------------
Everything is UR specific or supports pinocchio only simulation,
and only velocity-controlled robot functions exist.

long term vision
-------------------
Cut out the robot-specific parts out of the manager classes,
and create child classes for particular robots.
There is an interface to a physics simulator.
Functions for torque controlled robots exist.

    """
    ControlLoopManager
    -------------------
    Slightly fancier programming (passing a function as argument and using functools.partial)
    to get a wrapper around the control loop.
    In other words, it's the book-keeping around the actual control loop.
    It's a class because it keeps non-directly-control-loop-related parameters
    like max_iterations, what data to save etc.
    NOTE: you give this the ready-made control loop.
    if it has arguments, bake them in with functools.partial.
    Handles short-term data saving and logging.
    Details on this are given below.

    Short term data saving:
            - it's a dictionaries of deques (initialized here), because deque is the most convenient class 
              for removing the first element and appending a last (it is just a linked list under the hood of course).
            - it's a dictionary for modularity's sake, because this way you can save whatever you want
            - and it will just work based on dictionary keys.
            - it is the user's resposibility to make sure they're providing correct data.
            - --> TODO but make an assert for the keys at least
            - in the c++ imlementation, make the user write their own struct or something.
            - since this is python, you need to give me initial values to infer types.
            - you need to provide initial values to populate the deque to start anyway.

    Logging data (for analysis and plotting):
            - it can only be handled here because the control loop itself only cares about the present/
              a small time-window around it.
            - saves it all in a dictionary of ndarrays (initialized here), returns that after a run
              TODO: it's provided by the user now, make it actually initialize here!!!
            - you need to specify which keys you're using to do the initialization 
            - later, the controlLoop needs to return what's to be save in a small temporary dict.
            - NOTE: this is of course a somewhat redundant solution, but it's the simplest
              and most flexible way of doing it. 
              it probably will be done some other way down the line, but it works and is not
              a priority right now

    Other info:
    - relies on RobotManager to handle all the magic numbers 
      that are not truly only control loop related

    - right now it is assumed you're running this on UR5e so some
      magic numbers are just put to it.
      this will be extended once there's a need for it.
    - at this stage it's just a boilerplate reduction class
      but the idea is to inherit it for more complicated things
      with many steps, like dmp.
      or just showe additional things in, this is python after all
    - you write your controller separately,
      and then drop it into this - there is a wrapper function you put
      around the control loop which handles timing so that you
      actually run at 500Hz and not more.
    - this is probably not the most new-user friendly solution,
      but it's designed for fastest idea to implementation rate.
    - if this was a real programming language, all of these would really be private variables.
      as it currently stands, "private" functions have the '_' prefix 
      while the public getters don't have a prefix.

    ProcessManager
    --------------
    A way to do processing in a thread (process because GIL) different

    for ControlLoopManager.
    The primary goal is to process visual input
    from the camera without slowing down control.
    TODO: once finished, map real-time-plotting and 
    visualization with this (it already exists, just not in a manager).
    What this should do is hide the code for starting a process,
    and to enforce the communication defined by the user.
    To make life simpler, all communication is done with Queues.
    There are two Queues - one for commands,
    and the other for receiving the process' output.
    Do note that this is obviously not the silver bullet for every
    possible inter-process communication scenario,
    but the aim of this library is to be as simple as possible,
    not as most performant as possible.
    NOTE: the maximum number of things in the command queue is arbitrarily
        set to 5. if you need to get the result immediately,
        calculate whatever you need in main, not in a side process.
        this is meant to be used for operations that take a long time

        instead of having a queue for the commands, have a shared memory variable.

        instead of stacking up old commands in a queue.
        the locking and unlocking of the shared memory happens here 
        and you don't have to think about it in the control loop nor
        do you need to pollute half of robotmanager or whatever else
